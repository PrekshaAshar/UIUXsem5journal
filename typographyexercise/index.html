<h1>
    On Typography 
</h1>

<h2>
    herBerT Bayer | 1967
</h2>


<p>
    typography is a <span class="ONE">service art</span>, not a <span class="TWO">fine art</span>, however pure and elemental the discipline may be.  
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    the <span class="THREE">graphic designer</span> today seems to feel that the typographic means at his disposal have been exhausted. accelerated by the speed of our time, a wish for new excitement is in the air.<span class="FOUR">“new styles”</span> are hopefully expected to appear.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    <span class="FIVE">nothing is more constructive than to look the facts in the face.</span> what are they? the fact that nothing new has developed in <span class="SIX">recent decades?</span> the bore- dom of the dead end without signs for a <span class="SIX">renewal?</span> or is it the realization that a forced change in search of a <span class="FOUR">“new style”</span> can only bring <span class="SIX">superficial gain?</span>
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    it seems appropriate at this point to recall <span class="SEVEN">the essence of statements made by progressive typographers of the 1920s:</span> previously used largely as a medium for making  <span class="FOUR">language visible</span>, typographic material was discovered to have <span class="FOUR">distinctive optical properties</span> of its own, pointing toward specifically typographic expression. typographers envisioned possibilities of deeper visual experiences from a new exploitation of the typographic material itself.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    they called for <span class="SEVEN">clarity, conciseness, precision;clarity, conciseness, precision;</span> for more <span class="SEVEN">articulation, contrast, tension</span> in the color and black-and-white values of the typographic page.typography was for the first time seen not as an isolated discipline and technique, but in context with the ever-widening <span class="EIGHT">visual experiences</span> that the <span class="SIX">picture symbol, photo, film, and television</span> brought.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    they recognized that in all human endeavors a <span class="THREE">technology</span> had adjusted to man’s demands; while no marked change or improvement had taken place in man’s most profound invention, <span class="NINE">printing-writing, </span>since gutenberg.
the manual skill and approach of the <span class="TWO">craftsman</span> was seen to be inevitably replaced by <span class="ONE">mechanical techniques.</span>
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    once more it became clear that typography is not <span class="SEVEN">self-expression</span> within predetermined <span class="EIGHT">aesthetics,</span> but that it is conditioned by the message it visualizes.that <span class="FOUR">typographic aesthetics were not stressed in these statements does not mean a lack of concern with them.</span> but it appears that the searching went beyond surface effects into underlying strata. it is a fallacy to believe that styles can be created as easily and as often as <span class="TWO">fashions</span> change. more is involved than trends of taste devoid of <span class="SIX">inner substance and structure,</span> applied as cultural sugar-coating.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    moreover, the <span class="NINE">typographic revolution</span> was not an isolated event but went hand in hand with a new <span class="SEVEN">social, political consciousness</span> and, consequently, with the building of new cultural foundations. the <span class="TWO">artist’s</span> acceptance of the <span class="THREE">machine</span> as a tool for mass production has had its impression on <span class="EIGHT">aesthetic concepts.</span> since then an age of  <span class="ONE">science</span> has come upon us, and the <span class="TWO">artist</span> has been motivated more than ever to open his mind to the new forces that <span class="TEN">shape</span> our lives.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    <span class="SEVEN">new concepts will not grow on mere design variations of long-established forms such as the book.</span> the <span class="EIGHT">aesthetic</span> restraint that limits the development of the book must finally be overcome, and <span class="SIX">new ideas must logically be deduced from the function of typography and its carriers.</span> although i realize how deeply anchored in <span class="EIGHT">tradition</span> and how petrified the subject of <span class="NINE">writing and spelling</span> is, a new typography will be bound to an alphabet that corresponds to the demands of an <span class="ONE">age of science.</span> it must, unfortunately, be remembered that we live in a time of great ignorance and lack of concern with the <span class="SEVEN">alphabet, writing, and typography.</span> with nostalgia we hear of times when literate people had <span class="SEVEN">knowledge, respect, and understanding</span> of the subject. common man today has no opinion at all in such matters. it has come to a state where even the <span class="NINE">typesetter,</span> the original <span class="NINE">typographer,</span> as well as the <span class="NINE">printer,</span> has lost this culture. responsi- bility has been shifted onto the shoulders of the <span class="EIGHT">designer</span> almost exclusively.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    <span class="SIX">in the united states the art of typography, book design, visual communication at large, in its many aspects, is being shelved as a minor art.</span> it has no adequate place of recognition in our institutions of <span class="EIGHT">culture.</span> the <span class="THREE">graphic designer</span> is designated with the minimizing term  <span class="SEVEN">“commercial”</span> and is generally ignored as compared to the prominence accorded by the <span class="NINE">press</span> to architecture and the <span class="TWO">“fine arts.” </span>visual communication has made revolutionary strides and real contributions to the <span class="ONE">contemporary world </span>picture. yet, the <span class="TWO">artist-typographer</span> represents a small number of typography producers compared to the output of the nation. their efforts must be valued as they keep the <span class="EIGHT">aesthetic</span> standards from falling, and because they alone set the pace in taste.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    there can be no doubt that our writing-printing-reading methods are <span class="SEVEN">antiquated and inefficient</span> as compared to the perfection attained in other areas of human endeavor.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    the history of our <span class="NINE">alphabet</span> and any probing into its <span class="ONE">optical effectiveness</span> expose a lack of <span class="SIX">principle and structure, precision and efficiency</span> that should be evidenced in this important tool.
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    <span class="SEVEN">attempts have been made to design visually (to distinguish from aesthetically) improved alphabets.</span> but <span class="EIGHT">redesigning</span> will rest in just another <span class="NINE">typeface</span> unless the design is primarily guided by optics as well as by a revision of spelling. this, in turn, reveals the need for a clearer relation of <span class="NINE">writing-printing</span> to the <span class="TEN">spoken word,</span> a reorganization of the <span class="TEN">alphabetic sound-symbols, </span>the creation of new symbols. the type <span class="EIGHT">designer</span> is not usually a language reformer, but a systematic approach will inevitably carry him to a point where he will ask for nothing less than a <span class="SEVEN">complete overhaul of communication with visual sound.</span>
</p>

<P>

</P>

<p>
    however unlikely the possibilities for the adoption of such far-reaching renovation appears at the moment, <span class="SEVEN">revitalization</span> of <span class="NINE">typography</span> will come:</p>
    <p>a. from the increased demands made on the <span class="SIX">psychophysiologic</span> apparatus of our perceptive senses;</p>
    <p>b. from a <span class="SIX">new alphabet;</span></p>
    <p>c. from the <span class="SIX">different physical forms</span> that the carriers of typography will take. <span class="SEVEN">the more we read, the less we see.</span>constant exposure to visual materials has dulled our sense of seeing. </p>
    <p> <span class="ELEVEN">overfed with reading as we are, the practice of reading must be activated.</span> a new effort is needed to recapture and retain <span class="SIX">fresh- ness.</span> little known is the fact that the act of <span class="TEN">seeing</span> is work, that it demands more than a quarter of the nervous energy the human body burns up. <span class="SEVEN">during waking hours your eyes almost never rest.</span> in reading this article you must refocus as you skip from  <span class="ELEVEN">word </span> to <span class="ELEVEN">word </span>. much energy is required for <span class="TEN">blinking</span> and turning the<span class="TEN"> eyeballs.</span> more is needed by the tiny ciliary muscles to alter the <span class="TEN">shape</span> of the crystalline lens for focusing. the effort of seeing contributes a large share to physical tiredness.</p>
